# Ahmad's Dotfiles
This repository serves as my way to help me setup and maintain my Mac. It takes the effort out of installing everything manually. Everything which is needed to install my preffered setup of macOS is detailed in this readme.

### Manually set Git credentials
> Not in the repository, to prevent people from accidentally committing under my name

```
git config --global user.name "GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
git config --global user.email "GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
```

### Todo
- Enable tree finger drag.
- Remove default spotlight keyboard shortcut.
- Install oh-my-zsh via shell
- Symlink aliases.zsh to .oh-my-zsh/custom
